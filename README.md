# Stock Analyzer & Predictor

This is a personal project where I built a simple stock analyzer and prediction tool.  
It uses **Fibonacci Retracement** along with **confirmation signals** to help figure out whether there might be upcoming buying interest in a stock.

I created this to explore how technical indicators can be used to guide decisionsâ€”not just based on price, but on patterns and zones where reversals or continuations might happen.

### ðŸ”§ Features

- Fibonacci retracement level calculations
- Confirmation checks for potential entries
- Focus on identifying early signs of interest before major moves

### ðŸš¨ Disclaimer

This is a learning project and **not** financial advice.  
I'm using this to study patterns, trends, and how technical analysis worksâ€”not to guarantee any outcomes in the market.
